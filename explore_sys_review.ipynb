(n=21) to patients receiving placebo (n=19). the authors used standardized structured psychiatric instruments for diagnosis of adhd. to measure improvement, they used separate assessments of adhd, depression, and anxiety symptoms at baseline and each weekly visit. results: of the 40 subjects (55% male) enrolled in the study, 38 completed the study. bupropion treatment was associated with a significant change in adhd symptoms at the week-6 endpoint (42% reduction), which exceeded the effects of placebo (24% reduction). in analyses using a cutoff of 30% or better reduction to denote response, 76% of the subjects receiving bupropion improved, compared to 37% of the subjects receiving placebo. similarly, in analyses using clinical global impression scale scores, 52% of the subjects receiving bupropion reported being \"much improved\" to \"very improved,\" compared to 11% of the subjects receiving placebo. conclusions: these results indicate a clinically and statistically significant effect of bupropion in improving adhd in adults. the results suggest a therapeutic role for bupropion in the armamentarium of agents for adhd in adults, while further validating the continuity of pharmacological responsivity of adhd across the lifespan.\n",

       "496    objectives: the primary objective was to compare the differences in clinical efficacy of the starting dose of ritalin la (20mg) to the starting dose of concerta (18mg), in a laboratory school setting for the duration of an entire school day. secondary objectives were to compare ritalin la 20mg with concerta 36mg, and ritalin la and both concerta doses versus placebo across the school day. methods: thirty-six children (29 males, 7 females), aged 6-12 years, with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, previously stabilized on methylphenidate (mph), completed this four-way, randomized, single-blind crossover, analog classroom study. patients were evaluated on day 0 and randomized to receive treatment on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 (ritalin la 20mg, concerta 18mg, concerta 36mg, or placebo). results: swanson, kotkin, agler, m-flynn and pelham rating scale (skamp)-attention: the effect of ritalin la 20mg across the morning was statistically different from that of concerta 18mg and 36mg, as demonstrated by the change in the area under the curve (auc) during the first 4 hours (0-4) from pre-dose. auc((0-4)) for ritalinla was -2.48 versus -1.36 for concerta 18mg (p = 0.015), and -1.55 for concerta 36mg (p = 0.043). auc((0-8)) change from pre-dose for ritalin la was -4.48 versus -2.72 for concerta 18mg (p = 0.074), and -3.24 for concerta 36mg (p = 0.208).skamp-deportment: auc((0-4)) for ritalin la was -1.67 compared with -0.28 for concerta 18mg (p < 0.001), and -0.55 for concerta 36mg (p = 0.004). auc((0-8)) change from pre-dose for ritalin la was -2.81 compared with -0.82 for concerta 18mg (p = 0.018), and -1.34 for concerta 36mg (p = 0.078).combined: mean auc((0-4)) change from pre-dose for ritalin la was -2.05 compared with -0.78 for concerta 18mg (p < 0.001), -1.01 for concerta 36mg (p = 0.003). the mean auc((0-8)) change from pre-dose for ritalin la was -3.58 compared with -1.70 for concerta 18mg (p = 0.010), -2.22 for concerta 36mg (p = 0.061). math test-attempted: mean pre-dose score for ritalin la was about 73 compared with 74, 90, and 81 for concerta 18mg, 36mg, and placebo, respectively. mean auc((0-8)) change from pre-dose for ritalin la was 202 compared with 115 for concerta 18mg (p = 0.135), 137 for concerta 36mg (p = 0.265). math test-correct: mean pre-dose score for ritalin la was 68 compared with 64, 78, and 76 for concerta 18mg, 36mg, and placebo, respectively. mean auc((0-8)) change from pre-dose for ritalin la was 183 compared with 100 for concerta 18mg (p = 0.144), and 117 for concerta 36mg (p = 0.245). safety: one patient from each treatment group experienced a single mild adverse event that included abdominal pain, nausea, and dyspnea. conclusion: while both ritalin la and concerta were shown to be effective, the different release profiles of each formulation can result in distinct differences between the effects on measures of attention and deportment.\n",

       "1      background and methods: use of nicotine-replacement therapies and the antidepressant bupropion helps people stop smoking. we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of sustained-release bupropion (244 subjects), a nicotine patch (244 subjects), bupropion and a nicotine patch (245 subjects), and placebo (160 subjects) for smoking cessation. smokers with clinical depression were excluded. treatment consisted of nine weeks of bupropion (150 mg a day for the first three days, and then 150 mg twice daily) or placebo, as well as eight weeks of nicotine-patch therapy (21 mg per day during weeks 2 through 7, 14 mg per day during week 8, and 7 mg per day during week 9) or placebo. the target day for quitting smoking was usually day 8. results: the abstinence rates at 12 months were 15.6 percent in the placebo group, as compared with 16.4 percent in the nicotine-patch group, 30.3 percent in the bupropion group (p<0.001), and 35.5 percent in the group given bupropion and the nicotine patch (p<0.001). by week 7, subjects in the placebo group had gained an average of 2.1 kg, as compared with a gain of 1.6 kg in the nicotine-patch group, a gain of 1.7 kg in the bupropion group, and a gain of 1.1 kg in the combined-treatment group (p<0.05). weight gain at seven weeks was significantly less in the combined-treatment group than in the bupropion group and the placebo group (p<0.05 for both comparisons). a total of 311 subjects (34.8 percent) discontinued one or both medications. seventy-nine subjects stopped treatment because of adverse events: 6 in the placebo group (3.8 percent), 16 in the nicotine-patch group (6.6 percent), 29 in the bupropion group (11.9 percent), and 28 in the combined-treatment group (11.4 percent). the most common adverse events were insomnia and headache. conclusions: treatment with sustained-release bupropion alone or in combination with a nicotine patch resulted in significantly higher long-term rates of smoking cessation than use of either the nicotine patch alone or placebo. abstinence rates were higher with combination therapy than with bupropion alone, but the difference was not statistically significant.\n",

(2) according to the studies published to date, sertindole and quetiapine are as effective as haloperidol, and risperidone and olanzapine are slightly more effective than haloperidol in the treatment of global schizophrenic symptomatology. (3) with respect to negative symptoms, all new antipsychotics are more effective than placebo. however, contrary to widespread opinion, so is the 'conventional' antipsychotic haloperidol. risperidone and olanzapine are slightly superior, sertindole is as effective and--according to the only study fully published to date--quetiapine is even slightly less effective than haloperidol in this regard. (4) all new antipsychotics are associated with less frequent use of antiparkinson medication than haloperidol, with risperidone appearing to have a slightly less favourable eps-profile than the other new antipsychotics. the methodological limitations of this review, the generalizability of the results and expectations from future research are discussed.\n",
